# Knitwear-Printer-V2
This code in this repository controlled the movements of each part of the Knitwear Printer V2.

The Knit file contains all of the movements except for the stepper motor's. The Knit code was used on an Arduino Mega.

The dance file contains the movements used during demoing, except for the stepper motor's. This was also used with the Arduino Mega.

The Stepper file has the code used to make the stepper motor spin in one direction, then the other. It was used with an Arduino Uno with a motor shield.
